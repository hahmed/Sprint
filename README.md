# Sprint

Sample asp.net/mvc app showing how to use the github api via octokit.net [https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net]

## Scenario

The bosses sometimes don't wanna know what's happening on GitHub, we have our own dashboard for our app, they want work done,
so we created the sprint board. A simple agile concept where our bosses can see our current sprint.

Add and remove issues to the sprint board, once they are done, close them right off.

## Build and running

To run this app, make sure to enter your api key in the web.config file

<add key="Sprint.GitHubKey" value="your_api_key" />

To generate an api key, create a personal access token via: https://github.com/settings/tokens
